Cosmic Coffee Crafters began with the concept that coffee is more than a product, it's an experience.
It's the feel of the warm cup in your hand. The familiar-yet-exotic aroma. The taste, so beautifully complex. The effect the coffee has on your soul.
None of this comes easy. The best coffee beans come from a thin band around the equator, with the perfect geography of steep mountainsides, thick old-growth forests and ancient soils. We avoid the coffee markets, instead partnering directly with the local producers in these distinct regions.
Cosmic Coffee brings the best the world has to offer in single-source coffee to waiting cups around the Capital Region.

Colombia Ocamonte is sourced from the Asociación de Pequeños Caficultores de Ocamonte (APCO). APCO consists of about 270 families from the municipality of Ocamonte in the department of Santander, Colombia. Members of APCO currently cultivate a coffee varietal
called Castillo. The National Federation of the Coffee Growers of Colombia commissioned the development of this coffee variety, Castillo, because it is more resistant to Roya (coffee rust). This helped to increase both the national harvest and the quality of the coffee beans.

Rwanda Gatare
$13.75
Medium

Many view Rwanda as a country blessed with excellent coffee growing conditions. The high altitude, regular rainfall, organically-rich volcanic soil, and prosperity of the Bourbon varietal contribute to an ecosystem many coffee producers envy. Roughly half a million smallholder farmers and their one-hectare parcels of land make up Rwanda's coffee production force. These farmers are members of cooperatives and share the services of centralized washing stations. We are excited to feature this fantastic offering from Gatare and the many farmers who have contributed to it. 

Region: Africa
Process: Washed
Tasting Notes: Tangerine, Hibiscus, Raisin
Brewing Suggestions: Pour Over, Drip, Chemex
